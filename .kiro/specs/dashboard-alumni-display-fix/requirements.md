# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing critical issues in the Alumni Management Dashboard where the dashboard appears empty and newly added alumni data (including images) are not displaying properly. The system currently has a complete UI/UX implementation and backend API, but there are data flow and integration issues preventing proper display of alumni information and dashboard metrics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the dashboard to display accurate metrics and data, so that I can see the current state of the alumni network instead of an empty dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display current alumni count, active members, upcoming events, and recent donations
2. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL fetch real data from the backend API instead of showing empty states
3. WHEN there are alumni in the database THEN the system SHALL display the correct total count in dashboard metrics
4. WHEN there are recent activities THEN the system SHALL show them in the activity feed
5. IF the API fails to load data THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages instead of empty states
6. WHEN dashboard data is loading THEN the system SHALL show loading skeletons instead of empty content

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want newly added alumni to appear in the alumni directory immediately after creation, so that I can verify the data was saved correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new alumni profile is created THEN the system SHALL immediately refresh the alumni directory to show the new entry
2. WHEN viewing the alumni directory THEN the system SHALL display all alumni profiles from the database
3. WHEN an alumni profile is saved THEN the system SHALL return the complete profile data including the generated ID
4. WHEN the alumni list is refreshed THEN the system SHALL fetch the latest data from the backend API
5. IF alumni data fails to load THEN the system SHALL display an error message and retry option

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want alumni profile images to display correctly after upload, so that the profiles are visually complete and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an alumni profile image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL save the image to the server and return the image URL
2. WHEN viewing an alumni profile THEN the system SHALL display the uploaded image if available
3. WHEN an image upload fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry
4. WHEN no image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL display a default placeholder image
5. WHEN images are displayed THEN the system SHALL handle different image sizes and formats properly
6. IF an image URL is broken THEN the system SHALL fallback to the default placeholder

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the system to handle API errors gracefully, so that I understand what went wrong and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API request fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message explaining what happened
2. WHEN there are network connectivity issues THEN the system SHALL show a retry button and offline indicator
3. WHEN the backend server is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a maintenance message
4. WHEN data validation fails THEN the system SHALL highlight the specific fields with errors
5. WHEN authentication expires THEN the system SHALL redirect to login with a clear message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the alumni data to persist correctly in the database, so that information is not lost after creation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN alumni data is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields before saving
2. WHEN alumni data is saved THEN the system SHALL store it permanently in the MongoDB database
3. WHEN retrieving alumni data THEN the system SHALL return complete profile information including images
4. WHEN updating alumni data THEN the system SHALL preserve existing information while updating changed fields
5. IF database operations fail THEN the system SHALL log the error and display appropriate user feedback

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want real-time feedback during data operations, so that I know when actions are in progress or completed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting forms THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators and disable submit buttons
2. WHEN data is being saved THEN the system SHALL display progress feedback
3. WHEN operations complete successfully THEN the system SHALL show success notifications
4. WHEN operations fail THEN the system SHALL show error notifications with details
5. WHEN data is loading THEN the system SHALL show skeleton loaders instead of blank content
