# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the rate limiting issues currently affecting the Alumni Management Dashboard. The system is experiencing excessive API requests that are triggering rate limits, particularly on dashboard statistics endpoints. This is causing poor user experience with frequent "Rate limit exceeded" errors and preventing normal application functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Frontend Request Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dashboard to load efficiently without hitting rate limits, so that I can access all features without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL make no more than 5 concurrent API requests
2. WHEN dashboard data is refreshed THEN the system SHALL implement a minimum 30-second interval between automatic refreshes
3. WHEN multiple components request the same data THEN the system SHALL deduplicate requests and share responses
4. WHEN a user navigates between pages THEN the system SHALL cancel pending requests from the previous page
5. IF an API request fails due to rate limiting THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic

### Requirement 2: Backend Rate Limit Configuration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want appropriate rate limits that balance security with usability, so that legitimate users can access the system without unnecessary restrictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL allow 2000 requests per 15-minute window per IP
2. WHEN accessing dashboard statistics endpoints THEN the system SHALL allow 500 requests per 15-minute window per user
3. WHEN accessing general API endpoints THEN the system SHALL allow 1000 requests per 15-minute window per user
4. IF rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return proper HTTP 429 status with retry-after headers
5. WHEN rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for monitoring

### Requirement 3: Request Caching and Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want dashboard data to load quickly and efficiently, so that I don't experience delays or rate limit errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dashboard statistics are requested THEN the system SHALL cache responses for 60 seconds
2. WHEN the same data is requested within the cache period THEN the system SHALL return cached data without making API calls
3. WHEN cached data expires THEN the system SHALL refresh data in the background while serving stale data
4. WHEN multiple tabs are open THEN the system SHALL share cache across browser tabs
5. IF the cache becomes invalid THEN the system SHALL clear it and fetch fresh data

### Requirement 4: Real-time Data Strategy

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see updated dashboard information without overwhelming the server, so that I have current data while maintaining system stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dashboard is active THEN the system SHALL use WebSocket connections for real-time updates instead of polling
2. WHEN WebSocket is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to polling with 2-minute intervals
3. WHEN user is inactive for 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL pause automatic data refreshing
4. WHEN user becomes active again THEN the system SHALL resume data refreshing with a single refresh
5. IF real-time updates fail THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to manual refresh options

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when rate limits are encountered, so that I understand what's happening and how to proceed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN retrying after rate limits THEN the system SHALL show a countdown timer
3. WHEN requests are being throttled THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators with appropriate messaging
4. IF multiple rate limit errors occur THEN the system SHALL suggest refreshing the page or waiting
5. WHEN rate limits clear THEN the system SHALL automatically resume normal operation

### Requirement 6: Monitoring and Analytics

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want visibility into rate limiting patterns, so that I can optimize limits and identify issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL log request patterns and user behavior
2. WHEN monitoring rate limits THEN the system SHALL track requests per endpoint per user
3. WHEN analyzing usage THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on cache hit rates and request efficiency
4. IF unusual request patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators
5. WHEN optimizing performance THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations based on usage data
