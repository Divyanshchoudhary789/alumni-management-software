# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical API routing issue in the alumni management system where API endpoints are receiving a double `/api` prefix, causing 404 errors. The system currently has a configuration mismatch between the API client base URL handling and service endpoint definitions, resulting in malformed URLs like `/api/api/donations/stats/overview` instead of the correct `/api/donations/stats/overview`.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the API routing to work correctly so that all frontend requests reach their intended backend endpoints without 404 errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend makes an API call to any endpoint THEN the system SHALL construct the correct URL with a single `/api` prefix
2. WHEN accessing `/api/donations/stats/overview` THEN the system SHALL return donation statistics successfully
3. WHEN any service calls an API endpoint THEN the system SHALL NOT duplicate the `/api` prefix in the final URL
4. WHEN the API client constructs URLs THEN it SHALL handle endpoint paths consistently across all services

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent API client configuration so that all service calls follow the same URL construction pattern.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining service endpoints THEN the system SHALL use a consistent pattern for endpoint paths
2. WHEN the API client processes requests THEN it SHALL apply URL construction rules uniformly
3. WHEN adding new API endpoints THEN the system SHALL follow the established URL pattern to prevent routing conflicts
4. WHEN debugging API issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the attempted URL

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the alumni management system, I want all dashboard features to load properly so that I can access donation statistics and other data without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading the dashboard THEN all API-dependent components SHALL display data successfully
2. WHEN viewing donation statistics THEN the data SHALL load without 404 errors
3. WHEN navigating between different sections THEN all API calls SHALL complete successfully
4. WHEN the system encounters API errors THEN it SHALL provide meaningful feedback to the user
