# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical "Failed to load alumni profile" error that prevents users from viewing individual alumni profiles in the Alumni Management Dashboard. The error occurs when users attempt to access alumni profile pages, resulting in a poor user experience and inability to view detailed alumni information. This issue needs immediate resolution to restore core functionality of the alumni management system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to successfully load and view alumni profiles, so that I can access detailed information about individual alumni members.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to an alumni profile page THEN the system SHALL successfully load and display the complete alumni profile information
2. WHEN the alumni profile API is called THEN the system SHALL return valid alumni data without errors
3. WHEN an alumni profile exists in the database THEN the system SHALL retrieve and display all profile fields including personal information, education, and professional details
4. WHEN loading an alumni profile THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators while data is being fetched
5. IF an alumni profile doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL display a clear "Profile not found" message instead of a generic error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages when alumni profiles fail to load, so that I understand what went wrong and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an alumni profile fails to load due to network issues THEN the system SHALL display a specific network error message with retry option
2. WHEN an alumni profile fails to load due to server errors THEN the system SHALL display a server error message and suggest trying again later
3. WHEN an alumni profile ID is invalid THEN the system SHALL display a "Profile not found" message with navigation back to directory
4. WHEN API authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display an authentication error and redirect to login
5. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging purposes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable data fetching for alumni profiles, so that the system consistently works without intermittent failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching alumni profile data THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry logic for transient failures
2. WHEN API calls timeout THEN the system SHALL retry the request with exponential backoff
3. WHEN the backend service is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue requests and retry when service is restored
4. WHEN multiple users access the same profile THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests efficiently
5. WHEN profile data is successfully loaded THEN the system SHALL cache the data to improve subsequent load times

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper API integration and error handling, so that the alumni profile loading functionality is robust and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system makes API calls THEN it SHALL use the correct API endpoints and authentication
2. WHEN API responses are received THEN the system SHALL properly validate and transform the data
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement proper error boundaries to prevent application crashes
4. WHEN debugging issues THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logging and error tracking
5. WHEN API configuration changes THEN the system SHALL adapt without requiring code changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast and responsive alumni profile loading, so that I can quickly access the information I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading an alumni profile THEN the system SHALL display the profile within 2 seconds under normal conditions
2. WHEN profile images are included THEN the system SHALL load them asynchronously without blocking the main content
3. WHEN profile data is cached THEN subsequent loads SHALL be nearly instantaneous
4. WHEN the network is slow THEN the system SHALL show progressive loading of profile sections
5. WHEN profile loading takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators and estimated time remaining
