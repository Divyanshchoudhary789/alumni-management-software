# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhanced alumni features that extend the existing Alumni Management Dashboard. The system will add last updated timestamps to alumni profiles, enable alumni to offer both paid and free mentorship services, and allow alumni to create and manage their own paid and free events. These features will transform the platform from an admin-managed system to a more dynamic, alumni-driven community platform where alumni can actively contribute services and events.
